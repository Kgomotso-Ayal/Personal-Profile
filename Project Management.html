        <h1>Hi, I'm <span>Kgomotso Bonga</span><br>Below is the information about my experience learning Project Management</h1>

            <p>
                <br>Learning project management taught me to break down complex tasks into manageable phases, set realistic timelines, and align them with broader objectives. This has made me more organized and focused in both academic and practical settings.
                <br>
                <br>I now have a solid grasp of all phases of a project — initiation, planning, execution, monitoring, and closure. Understanding each phase has helped me appreciate the importance of planning and follow-through for successful outcomes.
                <br>
                <br>I’ve learned to effectively use tools such as Gantt charts, Work Breakdown Structures (WBS), and project scheduling software (like MS Project), which have improved my ability to track progress, allocate resources, and meet deadlines.
                <br>
                <br>Through practical exercises and simulations, I’ve developed the ability to manage scope, time, cost, and quality. This knowledge has helped me deliver tasks and mini-projects more efficiently and with greater accountability.
                <br>
                <br>By working on group projects and leading small teams, I learned how to delegate responsibilities, resolve conflicts, and keep the team focused on common goals. This experience has boosted my confidence in leadership roles.
                <br>
                <br>I now proactively identify potential risks, assess their impact, and develop contingency plans. This has helped me become more adaptable and resilient in handling unexpected challenges during project execution.
                <br>
                <br>I’ve become better at documenting project progress, presenting ideas clearly, and engaging with different stakeholders—whether technical team members, clients, or supervisors.
                <br>
                <br>Through coursework, simulations, and internships, I’ve applied what I’ve learned in realistic environments. This has significantly strengthened my readiness to take on professional project roles in the IT field and beyond.
                <br>
                <br>With my IT background, project management has enabled me to communicate technical requirements in an understandable way to non-technical stakeholders, making collaboration more effective.
                <br>
                <br>Overall, my experience learning project management has equipped me with essential skills that enhance my effectiveness in both academic and professional settings. I feel more prepared to tackle complex projects and contribute meaningfully to team efforts.
